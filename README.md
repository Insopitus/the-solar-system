# The Solar System
 trying to build the solar system w/ three.js

It's just a rough model of the sun and the 8 planets atm.
I may add satelites to it in the future.

All the planets' data is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System)

## UPDATE on March 3th, 2020
I just found out that if I use the real ratios of the planets and the distances between each other, these planets would be so small that you couldn't even spot them, which made the sun so "lonely". So I decide to make fake ratios just to make the model look better.

## How to build
I used parcel-bundler to pack this project. 
If you want build it youself, just run `npm install`, then `npm run build`
